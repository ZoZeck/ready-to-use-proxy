# 1-Command 3proxy Deploy

A self-contained script to **instantly** deploy a private [3proxy](https://github.com/3proxy/3proxy) proxy server on any fresh Ubuntu/Debian machine.

## ðŸ”¥ The "One Command" Method

This is the only method you need. Connect to your new server via SSH, and paste the following command. It will download the script and execute it, handling everything from installation to verification.

```bash
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/main/deploy.sh)
```
*(Remember to replace `YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO` with the actual path to your repository)*

#### **Optional: Specify a Port**

To use a custom port, simply add it to the end of the command:
```bash
bash <(curl -sL https://.../deploy.sh) 8080
```

## âœ¨ What It Does

-   **Runs Everywhere**: Works on any fresh Debian or Ubuntu server.
-   **Extremely Fast**: Installs a pre-compiled binary in ~15 seconds. No compilation needed.
-   **Self-Contained**: The script has no external dependencies besides `curl` and `python3`. The proxy test is embedded within it.
-   **Secure**: Generates a random username and password.
-   **Reliable**: Sets up a `systemd` service for auto-start and stability.
-   **Verified**: Automatically tests the proxy connection to ensure it's working before giving you the credentials.
-   **Clean**: Saves credentials to `/root/3proxy_credentials.txt` and leaves no other clutter.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

The project is intentionally minimalist. You only need to care about the `deploy.sh` script.
